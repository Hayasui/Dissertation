# Steam Data Collector Script Documentation

## Overview

The Steam Data Collector is a Python script designed to collect comprehensive game data from the Steam platform using the Steam Web API. It focuses on gathering information about games, their localisation status (particularly for Chinese languages), pricing in different regions, and user reviews across different languages. The script implements efficient data collection techniques including multi-key API access, caching, rate limiting, and parallel processing. The latest version features advanced tag extraction capabilities with robust HTML parsing, comprehensive store page scraping, and tools for updating existing datasets.

## Script Components

### Key Classes

#### `SteamAPIKeyManager`

-   Manages multiple Steam API keys to work within rate limits
-   Tracks usage of each key and automatically rotates keys when approaching limits
-   Implements daily reset of usage counters
-   Saves usage statistics for persistence between runs
-   Applies penalties to keys that encounter rate limits

#### `RateLimiter`

-   Controls the rate of concurrent API requests
-   Uses semaphores to manage access to resources
-   Helps prevent hitting Steam API rate limits

## Data Collection Process

The script follows a systematic process for collecting game data:

1.  **Initialisation**:
    -   Set up API key management
    -   Create directory structure
    -   Initialize caching system
2.  **Retrieve Game List**:
    -   Call the Steam API to get a complete list of applications
    -   Prepare the list for detailed processing
3.  **Game Processing (for each game)**:
    -   Check review count threshold (â‰¥ 100 reviews)
    -   Verify the app is a game (not DLC or other content)
    -   Apply the filtering criteria for game tags
    -   Collect basic game information from API
    -   Always retrieve additional tags from store pages for comprehensive coverage
    -   Fetch Chinese localisation and pricing details
    -   Retrieve and analyse language support
    -   Collect review metrics by language
    -   Gather current player count
4.  **Data Storage**:
    -   Save results incrementally to CSV
    -   Export final data in multiple formats for analysis
    -   Create R import script for seamless transition to R analysis

## Advanced Tag Extraction System

The script features a sophisticated tag extraction system that combines multiple data sources:

1.  **Multi-Source Tag Collection**:
    -   Always retrieves tags from both Steam API and store pages
    -   Combines API categories, user-defined tags, and scraped store tags
    -   Provides comprehensive tag coverage for all games
2.  **Robust HTML Parsing**:
    -   Uses BeautifulSoup for reliable HTML parsing instead of basic regex
    -   Implements multiple selector strategies for different HTML structures:
        - Primary selector: `div.glance_tags.popular_tags a.app_tag`
        - Secondary selector: `div.glance_tags a.app_tag`
        - Legacy selectors: `div.app_tags.popular_tags a.app_tag` and `div.popular_tags a.app_tag`
        - Fallback selector: `a.app_tag` (any app_tag element)
        - Enhanced regex pattern as final fallback
    -   Handles both visible and hidden tags for complete coverage
3.  **Enhanced Age Verification**:
    -   Automatically bypasses age gates on mature content
    -   Uses cookies and parameters to access age-restricted games
    -   Ensures tags are collected from all games regardless of content rating
4.  **Intelligent Tag Processing**:
    -   Filters out UI elements (like '+' add buttons)
    -   Handles various Steam HTML structures and layout changes
    -   Provides detailed logging of extraction methods used

## Dataset Update Feature

A comprehensive feature for enhancing existing datasets:

1.  **Targeted Tag Enhancement**:
    -   Updates games in existing datasets with newly extracted store page tags
    -   Preserves all other data while enhancing tag coverage
    -   Allows incremental improvement of datasets without full recollection
2.  **Controlled Processing**:
    -   Enables processing of a limited number of games for testing
    -   Implements incremental saving during updates
    -   Provides detailed progress tracking and statistics
3.  **Intelligent Tag Integration**:
    -   Adds only genuinely new tags to existing records
    -   Avoids semantic duplicates using sophisticated comparison
    -   Prevents genre duplication in tag lists
    -   Generates merged game_tags that combine user tags and genres
    -   Handles various data formats (lists, strings, JSON representations)

## Filtering Mechanism

The script implements a comprehensive filtering process to identify genuine games:

1.  **Review Threshold Filter**:
    -   Games must have at least 100 total reviews
    -   This ensures sufficient user engagement and data quality
2.  **DLC/Non-Game Identification**:
    -   Uses `check_app_relationship()` to identify DLCs and non-game content
    -   Examines app type, categories, and required apps
    -   Logs filtered apps for analysis and debugging
3.  **Required Gaming Tags Check**:
    -   Games must have at least one of the following tags:
        -   Single-player / Singleplayer
        -   Multi-player / Multiplayer
        -   PvP / Online PvP
        -   Online Co-op
    -   This helps identify actual playable games
4.  **Exclusion Tags Check**:
    -   Games are excluded if they contain any of these tags:
        -   Downloadable Content
        -   Demos
        -   Soundtracks
        -   Playtests
        -   Videos
        -   Mods
        -   Software
        -   Utilities
    -   This removes non-game content from the dataset
5.  **Additional Filters**:
    -   Games must have been released from 2010 onwards
    -   Games must have valid genre information
    -   Basic game metadata must be available
