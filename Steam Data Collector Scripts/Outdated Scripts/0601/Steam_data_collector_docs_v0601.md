# Steam Data Collector Script Documentation v0.6.01

## Overview

The Steam Data Collector is a Python script designed to collect comprehensive game data from the Steam platform using the Steam Web API. It focuses on gathering information about games, their localisation status (particularly for Chinese languages), pricing in different regions, and user reviews across different languages. The script implements efficient data collection techniques including multi-key API access, caching, rate limiting, parallel processing, and **enhanced thread-safe operations**. With the latest updates, it now includes enhanced tag extraction capabilities, tools for updating existing datasets, **improved data integrity verification**, and **robust thread-safe processing**.

## Script Components

### Key Classes

#### `DataCollectionState` **[NEW]**

- **Thread-safe state management** for concurrent processing
- Tracks processed app IDs and results across multiple threads
- Provides atomic operations for adding processed apps and checking status
- Ensures data consistency in parallel processing environments

```python
class DataCollectionState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.processed_app_ids = set()
        self.results = []
```

#### `SteamAPIKeyManager`

- Manages multiple Steam API keys to work within rate limits
- Tracks usage of each key and automatically rotates keys when approaching limits
- Implements daily reset of usage counters
- Saves usage statistics for persistence between runs
- Applies penalties to keys that encounter rate limits

#### `RateLimiter`

- Controls the rate of concurrent API requests
- Uses semaphores to manage access to resources
- Helps prevent hitting Steam API rate limits

## Data Collection Process

The script follows a systematic process for collecting game data with **enhanced reliability**:

1. **Initialisation**:
   - Set up API key management
   - Initialize **thread-safe state manager**
   - Create directory structure
   - Initialize caching system
   - **Optional cache clearing** for fresh starts

2. **Retrieve Game List**:
   - Call the Steam API to get a complete list of applications
   - **Sort apps by app_id for consistent processing order**
   - Prepare the list for detailed processing

3. **Game Processing (for each game)** with **Thread-Safe Operations**:
   - Check review count threshold (â‰¥ 100 reviews)
   - Verify the app is a game (not DLC or other content)
   - Apply the filtering criteria for game tags
   - Collect basic game information
   - Fetch Chinese localisation and pricing details
   - Retrieve and analyse language support
   - Collect review metrics by language
   - Gather current player count
   - **Thread-safe state updates and result storage**

4. **Data Storage** with **Enhanced Integrity**:
   - **Thread-safe incremental saving** to CSV
   - Export final data in multiple formats for analysis
   - Create R import script for seamless transition to R analysis
   - **Comprehensive data integrity verification**

## Tag Extraction Enhancements

The script includes significant improvements to tag extraction (unchanged from previous version):

1. **Robust HTML Parsing**: Uses BeautifulSoup for reliable HTML parsing
2. **Improved Age Verification**: Bypasses age gates on mature content

## Filtering Mechanism

The script implements a robust filtering process (unchanged filtering logic):

1. **Review Threshold Filter**: Games must have at least 100 total reviews
2. **DLC/Non-Game Identification**: Uses API relationship data to identify non-games
3. **Required Gaming Tags Check**: Games must have core gaming tags
4. **Exclusion Tags Check**: Removes non-game content
